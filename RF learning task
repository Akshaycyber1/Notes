🧭 RF Hacking Roadmap (Beginner Level)
📘 1. Introduction to Radio Frequency
What is RF?
Electromagnetic spectrum
Frequencies used in communication (AM, FM, UHF, VHF)
Bandwidth and signal modulation basics

🔧 Tools: Online spectrum chart viewer

📘 2. Modulation & Encoding Basics
Analog vs Digital signals
Common modulations: OOK, ASK, FSK, PSK, GFSK, LoRa
Baseband vs modulated signal
How encoding schemes (Manchester, NRZ, etc.) affect decoding

📚 Resource: Analog and Digital Communication by Simon Haykin (Basics) (Optional)

📘 3. Software Defined Radio (SDR) Fundamentals
What is SDR?
Difference between RTL-SDR, HackRF One, Yard Stick One
How SDR works (IQ sampling, ADC, etc.)
Installing SDR software

🔧 Tools:
RTL-SDR v3 (cheap)
SDR#, GQRX, GNU Radio, Universal Radio Hacker (URH)

📘 4. Signal Capture & Analysis
Capturing raw RF signals (RX)
Identifying protocols from unknown signals
Using URH to analyze waveform, decode bits
Frequency scanning

📚 Resource: "The Hobbyist's Guide to the RTL-SDR: Really Cheap Software Defined Radio" by Carl Laufer (Link)

📘 5. RF Replay Attacks
Understanding replay logic
Capturing a signal (garage remote, keyfob)
Replaying with HackRF or Flipper
What is rolling code vs fixed code?

🔧 Tools: HackRF, Flipper Zero, Yard Stick One, URH

📘 6. RFID & NFC Hacking (13.56 MHz / 125 kHz)
RFID vs NFC difference
Mifare Classic, NTAG213, HID Prox cards
Cloning access cards
Proxmark3 basics

📚 Book: "RFID Security and Privacy" by Ari Juels
🔧 Tools: Proxmark3 RDV4, Flipper Zero

📘 7. Sub-GHz IoT Hacking (315/433/868 MHz)
Smarthome devices, remote controls, sensors
Analyzing OOK/FSK signals
Cloning remote signals

🔧 Tools: HackRF, Yard Stick One, Flipper Zero

📘 8. Jamming and Denial-of-Service
Signal jamming principles
Legal consequences
How to jam Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/315MHz (in lab environments only!)

⚠️ Only use inside a Faraday cage or isolated testbed

📘 9. Building Custom SDR Workflows
GNU Radio 101: Blocks, flowgraphs
Creating decoders
Demodulating unknown protocols

Python scripting for SDR

📚 Book: "Software Defined Radio using MATLAB & Simulink and the RTL-SDR" by Robert W. Stewart
Resource: GNU Radio Tutorials on https://wiki.gnuradio.org

📘 10. Legality & Ethics
Radio regulations (in India: WPC/DoT)
ISM bands you can experiment with
Avoid transmitting on licensed bands
